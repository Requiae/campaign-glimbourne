This complex devoted to the King of Swords consists of several separate buildings surrounding a large courtyard. It was built in [[The city|Glimbourne’s]] early days. The style of the buildings is sturdy and serviceable with little decoration. The walls bear banners depicting “the broken blade”, a holy symbol of Intra. The courtyard is often used for combat training, and is sometimes borrowed by [[The Wardens|the Wardens]] for their trainings. The temple is known for its generosity, and the homeless and poor can usually find food and a place to sleep there. However, the temple is perpetually low on money, meaning that the buildings aren’t well-maintained and the food offered is of low quality.

Examples of places in the temple grounds are the dormitory, the kitchen, the mess hall, the armory, the temple, the library, the office of the Head Priestess.
