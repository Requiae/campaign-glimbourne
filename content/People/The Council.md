The Council is the collection of the five large organisations in [[The city|Glimbourne]]. Although they each have their own interest, values, and goals, they each share responsibility for the city and work together in harmony, each having their own tasks. The Council come together once every week to discuss the matters at hand, which usually focused on updates on research and trade. But recently the talks have been about missing staff.
