The Board of Construction represents a lot more people than its name suggests. The name stems from the early days of [[The city|Glimbourne]] when the [[The Council]] was just established, and most of the production needed was construction. These days the Board oversees all matters of production, and all artisans based in [[The city|Glimbourne]] can have their voice heard through the Board.
